# Jobly Backend

### Jobly is a full stack web app built with React, Node, Express, PostgreSQL, and Bootstrap.

This is the Express backend for Jobly, version 2.

### Note: 
- Although I wrote a version of the backend separately, the deployed version of this app uses the backend written by <a href="https://www.rithmschool.com/">Rithm School</a> (this was so that each pair could start with the same codebase when building out the React frontend).

#### To run this:

    node server.js
    
#### To run the tests:

    jest -i
